Basic Python programs written while learning Python

This repository contains very basic Python programs that I wrote while learning
core Python concepts.

Topics covered in this repository:
- Loops (for loop, while loop)
- Lists
- Tuples
- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Exception Handling

I am a first-semester AI/ML student and this repository represents
my learning journey in Python.
